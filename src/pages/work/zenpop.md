I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! But you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat. Fatal. Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo!
